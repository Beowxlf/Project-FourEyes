### Kernel Day 1 - Ring 0 and Kernel Fundamentals
- What is the kernel?
	- Core Windows component that manages memory, devices, and security
	- Located in ntoskrnl.exe
- User mode vs Kernel Mode
	- Ring 3 = User apps (limited)
	- Ring 0 = Kernel + Drivers (full power)
- Detection Implications
	- Malware that reaches Ring 0 is stealthier and harder to detect
	- Defender tools (EDR, Sysmon) often hook syscalls to gain visibiity
- Reflections
	- Why do EDRs run kernel-mode drivers?
	- What logs do we lose if malware bypasses syscall layer?
	-

### Kernel Day 1 - Thread Scheduling & IRQLs
- What is a Thread?
	- Basic unit of execution under a process
	- Managed by kernels's dispatcher
- What is an IRQL
	- CPU priority system for interupts
	- Higher IRQL cannot be interupted by lower levels
- Detection-Relevant Concept
	- Thread priority hijacking = EDR evasion
	- IRQL misuse = driver/rootkit territory
	- Scheduler starvation = stealthy malware anti-EDR
- Real Tools
	- Process Hacker: View/change thread priorities
	- WPR: Measure Scheduling behavior
- Reflections
	- If malware disables logs without killing processes, did it jus outrun us?
	- Can I write a rule to catch unusual IRQL usage or high-priority threads

### Kernel Day 3 -- Syscalls and SSDT
- Syscall Flow
	- USer > WinAPI > Nt API (ntdll.dll) > syscall > SSDT > Kernel function
- SSDT = System Service Dispatch Table
	- Table of syscall > function ptrs in kernel (ntoskrnl.exe)
- Attacker Techniques
	- Direct Syscalls (bypass hooks)
	- Syscall Stomping  (overwrite ntdll)
	- SSDT Patching (rootkits only)
- Detection Relevence
	- ETW and Kernel-Mode drivers are needed to **catch** this
	- Sysmon is insufficient if attacker never calls high-level API
- Tools
	- SysWhispers2
	- PE-sieve
	- Process Hacker (inspect ntdll memory)
- Reflection
	- What if malware uses direct syscall shellcode and never touches PowerShell or WinAPI?
	- How do I trace behavior with no logs
